# DisasterTweetAnalysis

Welcome to DisasterTweetAnalysis, a GitHub repository dedicated to leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and understand disaster-related tweets. Our project aims to provide valuable insights into various disaster events by processing and categorizing tweets, identifying different types of disasters, analyzing sentiment, and extracting key information.

## Project Goals

- **Data Processing**: Utilize NLP techniques to preprocess and clean raw tweet data for analysis.
- **Disaster Type Identification**: Develop models to automatically classify tweets into different disaster types such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of tweets to understand public reactions and emotions during disaster events.
- **Key Information Extraction**: Extract important information from tweets such as location, severity, impact, and assistance needs.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Robust data cleaning pipelines to handle noisy and unstructured tweet data.
- **Disaster Classification**: Machine learning and deep learning models for accurate classification of tweets into disaster categories.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment analysis algorithms to gauge the sentiment polarity of tweets (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Information Extraction**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and other techniques to extract key information from tweets.
